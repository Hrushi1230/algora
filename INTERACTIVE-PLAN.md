# Algora — Interactive Build Plan (Phase 2)

You already have **Phase 1**: image-generation prompts (`marketing-remaining.md`, `authentication.md`,
`onboarding.md`, `learning-product.md`, `gamification.md`, `account.md`, `supporting-pages.md`,
`roadmap-builder.md`, `admin.md`) → static screenshots → a static Lovable site.

**Phase 2 is this document:** turning that static site into the best DSA-learning product in the
world, in ordered batches of copy-paste Lovable prompts.

## The one idea that makes Algora better than every competitor

Every DSA site is either **an animation toy** (VisuAlgo, sorting-visualizer clones) or **a problem
grinder** (LeetCode). Nobody owns the middle. Algora's moat is a single technical decision:

> **Algorithms are executed once, as pure functions, and emit an immutable array of `Step`s.
> The canvas, the code pane, the explanation pane, the complexity counter, and the narration are
> all *pure functions of `steps[i]`*.**

Consequences that competitors cannot copy quickly:
- Perfect sync between visual / code line / English sentence — free, forever, on every algorithm.
- Scrub backwards. Time-travel debugging of an algorithm is a genuinely new learning experience.
- "Run it on **your** input" and "run it on **your** code" reuse the exact same player.
- Auto-generated quizzes ("what does the queue look like at step 7?") from the step log.
- Auto-generated spaced-repetition cards from the same step log.
- Deterministic → snapshot-testable → 60+ algorithms without visual regressions.

Every batch below protects that architecture. **Batch 3 is the company.** Do not skip it.

## Batch map

| # | File | Batch | Why here |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `interactive/batch-01-foundation.md` | Design system, tokens, fonts, shells, router, mock data | Everything else inherits this. Fix it once. |
| 2 | `interactive/batch-02-marketing-live.md` | Public pages become real: nav, hero live demo, pricing, forms, blog | Cheap wins, and it forces the player into existence early. |
| 3 | `interactive/batch-03-engine.md` | ★ The headless step-engine + playback store | The product. Pure TS, testable, no UI. |
| 4 | `interactive/batch-04-visualizer.md` | Renderers (array/tree/graph/grid/table) + 3-pane synced workspace | The flagship screen, now trivial because the engine exists. |
| 5 | `interactive/batch-05-explore-search.md` | Catalog, filters, live thumbnails, global search, path detail | Discovery layer over the algorithm registry. |
| 6 | `interactive/batch-06-lessons-review.md` | Lesson runner, inline quizzes, review queue + SM-2 scheduler | Turns visuals into retained knowledge. |
| 7 | `interactive/batch-07-practice-editor.md` | CodeMirror light editor, Web-Worker test runner, results screen | Practice loop. Sandboxed, no eval on the main thread. |
| 8 | `interactive/batch-08-gamification.md` | XP/level math, streaks, quests, mastery map, leagues, achievements | Retention. Built on one progress store. |
| 9 | `interactive/batch-09-onboarding-roadmap.md` | Goals → adaptive assessment → generated path, roadmap builder, account & analytics | Personalization; needs progress data to exist first. |
| 10 | `interactive/batch-10-backend-launch.md` | Supabase auth + schema + RLS, sync, admin console, hardening & launch | Last, so the client contract is already frozen. |

Each batch file contains: **Goal → Prerequisites → numbered copy-paste prompts → Acceptance
checklist → Known failure modes & repair prompts.**

## How to run a batch (repeat 10×)

1. Open `interactive/00-shared-context.md`, copy the **CONTEXT BLOCK**.
2. Open the batch file. For prompt 1: paste CONTEXT BLOCK, then the prompt body. Send.
3. Read the diff. If it touched files it shouldn't have, revert and re-send with
   `Only modify <exact paths>.`
4. Click through the app yourself. Test the acceptance line for that prompt.
5. Next prompt. Never batch two prompts into one message.
6. End of batch: run the Acceptance Checklist top to bottom. All green → snapshot/commit with the
   message `batch-0N: <name>`.
7. If a batch goes sideways, roll back to the last snapshot rather than patching forward.

## Rhythm that works

- 1 batch ≈ 1 focused session. Batches 3, 4 and 7 are the heavy ones — give each its own session.
- After batches 4, 7 and 8, do a "demo pass": record a 60-second screen capture. If it doesn't feel
  magic, fix feel before adding features.
- Do not start batch 10 (backend) until 1–9 are green. Auth bugs on top of UI bugs are 5× harder.

## Definition of done for Phase 2

- 43 student-facing routes reachable, no dead links, no placeholder screens.
- ≥ 12 algorithms fully visualized through the shared engine (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Topological
  Sort, Union-Find, Binary Search, Quicksort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Two Pointers, Sliding Window,
  0/1 Knapsack DP) with step-accurate code highlighting and narration.
- Scrub backwards works everywhere. Reduced-motion respected everywhere.
- Progress, XP, streak, and review scheduling survive a reload and a login on another device.
- Lighthouse ≥ 90 performance / 100 accessibility on `/` and `/algorithms/bfs`.
- Zero `any`, zero console errors, zero hardcoded hex outside the token file.

## Phase 3 (later — do not start early)

Content scale-up to 60+ algorithms via the registry; AI tutor that explains `steps[i]` in natural
language on demand; "explain my code" diff against the canonical step log; shareable step
permalinks (`/algorithms/bfs?input=…&step=7`) as the organic-growth loop; classroom/cohort
dashboards from `campus.md`; mobile app reusing `src/engine` unchanged.
